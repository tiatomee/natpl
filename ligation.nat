# Create a solution for ligation of an insert and
# a vector. 25ng of the vector should be used.
#
# The solution should have a 1:3 molar ratio of
# vector:insert

# Size of the molecules
is = 1.7 kbp
vs = 3.0 kbp

# Concentrations
ic = 3.2 ng/μL
vc = 10 ng/μL

# weight of one ratio insert
iw1 = (is / vs) * 25ng
iw3 = 3 iw1

# Volumes
vv = 25ng / vc
iv = iw3 / ic
